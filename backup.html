			<h2>Enhancement 1: Software Design and Engineering</h2>

			<b>
				<i>
					Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; This artifact is the server for a personal project called “Todo 2.0”. It is a web
				application that allows users
				to add and remove “todo” items from a list, so that they may track their productivity. It runs on the MERN
				stack
				currently, meaning it uses JS as the core language, Node as the JS runtime, Express as the HTTP server,
				MongoDB
				as
				the database, and React for the frontend client. It was initially created a little over 2 years ago as a
				personal
				project so that I could better learn how the MERN stack functioned.

					Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific
					components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact
					improved?
				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; I selected this item because it is a simple and straightforward project but includes all three areas of
				improvement that I must showcase for the capstone. It also presents a great opportunity to show how my skills as
				a
				developer have improved over the years, as I now have the ability to transition it to an entirely new language
				and
				database technology. The architecture of the server and the transition from Express/JS to Gin/Golang both
				showcase
				my software development skills, as it proves that I understand the flow of a server enough to implement it in
				multiple languages and paradigms. I improved the artifact by performing the aforementioned rewrite in Golang,
				which allows the server to run faster and be deployed more easily.
			</p>

			<b>
				<i>
					Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any
					updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; Yes, I met the planned objectives by rewriting the entire backend in a Golang. Right now, most of the
				routes are working with hard-coded data, as I have not yet implemented the database transition, but they
				showcase
				the basic functionality of the API that will be completed once I transition the database from MongoDB to
				Postgres.
				I may improve the architecture over time to update my outcome-coverage plan.
			</p>

			<b>
				<i>
					Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and
					improving it? What challenges did you face?
				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; I mainly learned how the functionality of a language naturally influences the architecture and logical
				flow
				of the software written with it. For example, Express and JS tend to lend themselves to more of a
				straightforward,
				simple routing pattern when it comes to writing HTTP server functionality. This is because of the ease and
				self-documenting nature of Express syntax. However, Gin and Golang present a slightly more complicated syntax,
				and
				therefore more documentation must be included, as the code is not self-documenting. One challenge I faced was
				keeping the data types in-sync between the frontend and backend when transitioning to Go. When they were both
				written in JS, it was much easier as I could use the same objects, but when they run on different languages,
				it's
				slightly harder to ensure that the types are equivalent. To help with this, I transitioned the React frontend
				from
				JavaScript to TypeScript.

					artifact improved?
				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; I selected this item because it presented a great chance to show my skills regarding algorithms and data
				structures. The main data structure of this program is an object (or struct in Golang) called a 'Todo', which
				features three fields: an unsigned integer called the “ID”, a string called the “Title”, and a string called the
				“Content”. The ID is a unique numeric key that is used to identify each Todo, and because of how Postgres works
				(which will be used to store the Todos in the next milestone), the array of Todos retrieved will not always be
				in
				order of these numeric ID's. The end user seeing the Todos on the frontend will want to see these Todos in
				order,
				therefore I implemented an algorithm known as “quicksort” to sort the array of Todos in ascending order of ID's
				before sending it to the frontend. This combination of designing and using the Todo data structure and sorting
				them with an algorithm showcases my skills in these areas.
			</p>

			<b>
				<i>
					Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any
					updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; Yes, I met the objectives I planned to meet. I do not plan to add any updates, as the quicksort algorithm
				is not something that can be “improved” per se. I may make changes to the Todo structure by adding fields, but
				they will always contain a numeric ID to be sorted by.
			</p>

			<b>

					Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and

				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; I learned that I did not understand the quicksort algorithm as well as I thought I did. I previously
				implemented a quicksort algorithm in C++ in the data structures and algorithms course, but I had not practiced
				implementing algorithms since then and therefore I was a little rusty. I had to watch some YouTube videos on how
				they worked, and it took some trial and error to get it right. I now feel that I have a much greater
				understanding
				of these algorithms, as well as recursion.

			<h2>Enhancement 3: Databases</h2>

				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; I selected this item because it presented a great chance to show my skills regarding implementing a
				database into a software project. This program needs a database so that the Todo items can be used across
				different sessions, as storing them in-memory would mean they would disappear whenever the executable stops
				running, making updates impossible. At the same time, it only needed two database objects, the Todo and User
				objects, which means it was fairly straightforward to implement. I implemented communication with a Postgres
				backend which consisted of a database named 'Todo' and two tables, one named “Users” and one named “Todos”. The
				API routes interacted with this database through a driver for Golang known as 'pgx' and I used prepared SQL
				queries to interact with Postgres directly instead of using an ORM.
			</p>

			<b>
				<i>
					Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any
					updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; Yes, I met the objectives I planned to meet. I do not plan to add any updates, as I do not foresee the
				need
				to add any further functionality beyond the basic CRUD operations that I have currently implemented.
			</p>

			<b>
				<i>
					Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and
					improving it? What challenges did you face?
				</i>
			</b>
			<p>
				&nbsp; I learned that, while good practice for SQL, writing prepared statements instead of using an ORM can make
				the process more difficult, especially when it comes to refactors. Anytime I wanted to add a column to a
				database
				table, it required making changes in three separate places: the SQL statements for creating the table, the SQL
				statements for querying the table, and the Go functions for executing the SQL statements. Although ORM’s can
				slow
				down performance, in bigger more complicated projects I can see how they may be useful. A good compromise would
				be
				using a code-gen solution that allows you to still use SQL but generates the statements for you based on the
				Golang structs.
